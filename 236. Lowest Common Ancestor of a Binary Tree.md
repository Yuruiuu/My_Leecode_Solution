# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Constraints:

+ The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
+ -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
+ All Node.val are unique.
+ p != q
+ p and q will exist in the tree.

# 思路
使用后序遍历，从下往上判断

如果当前节点的值等于p或q，则返回当前节点的值，否则返回nullptr

如果一个节点的左子树和右子树的返回值都不为空，则当前节点为最近公共祖先。

# AC代码
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (root == q || root == p || root == NULL) return root;
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        if (left != NULL && right != NULL) return root;
        if (left == NULL) return right;
        return left;
    }
};
```
