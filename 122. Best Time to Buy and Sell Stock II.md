# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 

> Example 1:
>
> Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
>
> Output: 7
>
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>
> Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
>
> Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

> Example 2:
>
> Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
>
> Output: 0
> Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
 
 # 思路——贪心
 由局部最优解推得整体最优解

 局部最优解是在低价时买入，高价时卖出，如果第二天股票价格比当天高，则买入

 由第二天股价减当天股价可得每天利润

 假设prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]，则每天利润profits=[-6,4,-2,3,-2]

 只要将利润数列中的正值加起来，就能得到最大利润4+3=7

 # AC代码
 ```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int result=0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.size()-1;i++){
            if(prices[i+1]-prices[i]>0){
                result+=prices[i+1]-prices[i];
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
